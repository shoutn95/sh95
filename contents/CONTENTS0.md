### &nbsp;<br />A long time ago I started to work in a french  company which was used since a long time to produce video games as software programs.  This company named [Cryo Interactive](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryo_Interactive) with [Philip Ulrich](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Ulrich) as creative Director, has also been known in the 80's with [Ére Informatique](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ère_informatique). At these "antic" (or anticipated ?)  times, we played some of their games as *Captain Blood* or *KULT*.<br />

### &nbsp;I started with a training period in a 3D graphic team as "producer assistant". As I was in<wterested with graphics, and video games, I also took part with graphics with Photoshop, After Effects and 3DS Max, and development with scripting. In 1997, CRYO is publishing [Atlantis](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis_:_Secrets_d%27un_monde_oublié) and [Versailles](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versailles_1685_:_Complot_à_la_cour_du_Roi_Soleil).<br />
### Their game engine was based in pre-calculed 3D pictures mapped within a sphere where player was wrapped. It was a kind of subjective adventure games forwarded in the past with the well known [Myst](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myst_(jeu_vidéo)), another subjective pre-calculed game, which was a kind of reference in the 90`s.<br />For now, I am a kind of these abandonware games, but still developping as I can some internet programs.<br />
