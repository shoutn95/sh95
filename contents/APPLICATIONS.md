#### [<FOOBAR_2000>](#)&nbsp;//As I always prefer digital artwork and digital impression (as a "pixelmator") I was kind when I found _foobar 2000_. It was an E.T. program compare to the classic Windows Media Player. We were able to make our own playlists for listening music; with no particular order - like "shuffeling the cards" - or  with sorting files by titles, artists or albums...<br /> With the *COMPONMENTS*, that add extra to the program, we are able to change the first and "unusable" interface (Columns UI) with skins that completely transform (UX) the user experience for individual preferences and simplicity. [Deviant-Art](https://www.deviantart.com) gather a lot of skins for that purpose. <br />Beyond the interface, there are many other add-ons where you may find some particular ones for listening singular format (as Amiga files from demoscene, Nintendo games music...), or streaming your music from a media server.{.tip}
