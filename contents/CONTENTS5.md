### I have been used readding adventure books which enable interactive immersion through a "playable" storybook. Your personal character have initial capabilities and become much more able through particulars moments and your particular way to achieve chapters with a randomly die. There is no particular order to achieve your story. A simple chapter can make your story ending, an another one for getting a new artifact, meeting friendly personage or an enemy. You should learn with friends but you would fight against enemies. Chapter after chapter you will make your personal story in a pre combined possibilities that you aimed with a die. Reading becomes a lonely defi.
