## There is Adobe, and there are plugins.
### <br />&nbsp;**What about a major program-software without third parties ?** It is a kind of a Robinson felled on his island. Most of software producers do not work in this way; Adobe as a major producer enables these third deployments as plugins.
### I am gonna discuss about graphics plug-ins which add to the initial software some major unexpected additions. Some of them are a program within the initial program. Nearly, a new software... After Effect is a "post production" animation software, and Adobe, as a major, collaborates with software engineers to deploy these additions. As these additions enable software to be more productive for making special and complex effects. Particules, lights, flares, motion special effects, colors's camera adjustments or 3D complex effects for rendering some a'mazing clips or movies. We look after these new effects (and now for applications...) for processing stupefying pictures. Here, I talk about plug-ins for professional engineers and creatives who dig into the software or plugins.
### And for now, we produce more and more pictures, motion pictures, motion pictures with audio sync... that can be done quickly. From the past we gain time, quality and quantity everyone focussed with programs and music, video games, internet and TV.
### A little tip for making your video sync with audio; extract the waveforme from your audio and transform it as image keys. Now you will be able to sync the waveform as keys. It is a good start to make mess or sync with an other layer object with his parameters linked to the "waveforme".{.tip}
