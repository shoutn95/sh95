### and persistance. I do not want to say that programing website is easy, where everyone can make what he wants and publish contents for peoples they care or everyone. Facebook, Instagram or Twitter can not be replaced for one who do not have knowledge for publishing on the web (I will say about keyword lately) and want to develop a kind of amabilis business information.<br />Some people could talk about Wordpress, Joomla, Typo3 or other CMS, but they stay developped for people able with computers and files administration. Deploying them needs to be very familiar with complex information. Besides, some SSII are specialized with these applications and make bussiness with free license collaborative applications. They develop options, and contribute for making the applications more adaptive for their needs and for everyone.That is the way when we have benefits with them. It is a kind of an hybrid development whith trunk, branches and contributors (SVN). We know Github about that, for versionning applications, and collaborative engineering. More adaptative means more productivity as we are willing for replicating them. <br /> As I have said, some of these CMS (Content Management System)  are used by business firms (SSII) where specialized people work, and can be used by everyone as much as these programs stay with a free license right, or commun right. But that is their facilities that we must consider for their accessibility. The initial process can be a lake where we stay close but can not be crossed.

### Facebook is an application, Twitter is an other, their accessibilities are evident, as well as Instagram. They are simple but not so obvious, as we consider tags. May can we consider them as a link? Databases are huges, and each one can with tracing the keyword reach all contents tagged.<br />Persistance of datas required database, that can be reach by a program which run on a computer with an other program which request an other computer where run an other program. All things with some structured langages, response each other.<br />I do not know all the kind of socialization programs that are used, but some of them consist of being here with a picture for just a couple of seconds after being deleted. You are in time or you were not.
