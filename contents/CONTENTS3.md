### Todays if you own a Windows computer, you may feel frusted for playing games. Some specialized stores do not sell anymore PC games; and if they do, you probably will find an empty box with no physical DVD or blue-ray discs. You are aware with a serial number for downloading the games from a specialized digital store.<br /> Why do I say returning to the "antic" ages ? Original personnal mashines (Spectrum, Amstrad, Commodore) were provided with data system tapes (K7). Loading a game took a long time, long enough for waiting with a well pictured and digitalized painting that hand and foot your monitor screen, with synthesis audio while datas decrunching, until the game start up with a welcome menu.<br />

### Today you buy a license with a serial number or digital money to download games datas. Also, it needs to manage this time which can take a couple of hours with the same freeze screens that sequence the game context before its launching; as it was with my original game tapes - and floppies, in the 80's years.

### Well coverage games are huge of datas that you need to download before playing ; no more booklets, no maps, no illustrations, no extra to come within your game's box. Your library is on the "cloud", you are assigned with an account ID that identify your collection that you never should lose or re sale... These third party platforms - Steam (Valve), GOG (CD Projekt) are specialized and bring to gamers social extras plus : sales, videos, forums, discussions, opinions. Independant software developers have no choice in front of these editors, distributors and influencers for their games to be published. Big major editor develop their own software launchers : Origin (EA), Uplay (Ubi-Soft) with same extras (DLC, sales, demos...) if you use them ; sometimes with no choice to add to your system their shell launcher. Has entertainment games software industry find a parad against games piracy ? In the 90's _"evils software piracy"_ has loomed many games software editors while internet becames to be known as the new bubble for software developpment.<br /> I can not talk about the future cloud gaming that Google is starting with Stadia. It is a kind of a prepaid subscription for streaming  playable games through your internet bandpath, as we already find for retro gaming (Mame online Emulator). However, comparing these retro arcade games with the latest games developpment needs some explanation about the hability to stream playable AAA games datas, as Netflix do with series... to be continued.
